Type 'exit' to stop the system:\n","Good afternoon everyone, let’s begin the weekly product sync meeting. The main objective today is to review the current release status and finalize next steps. Project Phoenix is currently running one week behind the planned schedule. After reviewing the latest progress report, we agreed to move the deployment date to October 15. Rahul will be responsible for coordinating with the DevOps team to update the deployment pipeline. Ananya mentioned that there are still some unresolved UI issues on the checkout page. She will complete the UI fixes and share an update by this Friday. There was a discussion about whether the existing cloud budget can support increased traffic during launch. This point is still unclear and needs confirmation from the finance team. The security team confirmed that all critical vulnerabilities identified last sprint have been resolved. However, it has not been decided who will monitor system metrics during the first 24 hours post-deployment. Should we assign on-call responsibility to the DevOps team for the launch window? Let’s revisit the monitoring decision once we receive the budget confirmation. If there are no further questions, we can close today’s meeting.\n","\n","📌 KEY DECISIONS\n","• After reviewing the latest progress report, we agreed to move the deployment date to October 15.
